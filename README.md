# Comet-Ask-Navigator-Bookmarklet
Adds a Table of Contents (TOC) sidebar for your questions in Comet browser threads

# Comet Ask Navigator

A bookmarklet tool for the **Perplexity Comet browser** that creates a Table of Contents (TOC) sidebar for your questions.

## Features

- Automatically lists all your questions in a thread.
- Smooth scrolling to any question by clicking its TOC entry.
- Hide/Expand sidebar to save screen space.
- Numbered and highlighted entries for clarity.
- Compact, non-intrusive design.
- If you move to another thread, click Hide and then Expand to refresh the TOC for that new thread.
- Shrink the TOC to a small strip on the side to avoid obstructing content, and expand it back when needed.

## How to Use

1. Copy the `bookmarklet.js` code into a browser bookmark.
2. Open a Comet browser thread with your questions.
3. Click the bookmarklet â€” the sidebar TOC appears.
4. Click any entry to jump directly to that question.
5. Use **Hide** to remove the sidebar and **Expand** to restore it.
